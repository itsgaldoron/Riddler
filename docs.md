# Riddler Documentation (Redirected)
*Version: 1.0.0*

> **Note:** The documentation has been reorganized into a more structured format. Please visit the [documentation directory](docs/index.md) for the most up-to-date and comprehensive documentation.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is now organized into the following sections:

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) - Installation and basic usage
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) - Configuration options and examples
- [Features](docs/features.md) - Detailed feature descriptions
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - System architecture and components
- [Advanced Usage](docs/advanced_usage.md) - Advanced usage scenarios
- [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
- [Development Guidelines](docs/development.md) - Guidelines for developers

## Why This Change?

The documentation has been restructured to:

1. Make it easier to find specific information
2. Separate concerns into logical sections
3. Improve maintainability of documentation
4. Follow best practices for project documentation

This file will be removed in a future release.
